####  Lossy - Image Compressing using FFT method

# The goal of the project is to compress jpeg image by using the Fast Fourier Transformation Method
# This project uses python 3.X
# The required libraries are mentioned in requirements.txt
# To install said libraries, run the following command

  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# To run the python program and compress images,
  1)store the images you want to compress into input
  2)open cmd in this project folder or open this folder in your IDE
  3)run the main.py script
  4)the program will ask you what % of the highest Fourier coefficients do you want to keep
  5)enter your desired % input
  6)the program will then compress your images and said compressed output images will be stored in the output folder

# for demonstration purposes, sample images have been stored into the input folder
# note that this program can only provide grayscale output, however you can input a coloured image and the program
  will provide a compressed grayscale output
